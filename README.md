## Overview

This project is a **News & Weather Dashboard** web app that combines real-time news fetching and weather display based on the user's current location or search input. The main focus of this project is to **learn how to work with APIs and manipulate the DOM using JavaScript**. This project provides hands-on experience with asynchronous JavaScript (fetch, promises, async/await), event handling, and dynamic HTML updates.

## Features

- **Search News**: Users can search for news articles by keywords using a public News API.
- **Current Location Weather**: Automatically detects the user's geographic location and displays current weather info.
- **City Image Display**: Fetches a relevant city image using the Pexels API to enhance the visual experience.
- **Dynamic UI Updates**: News articles and weather info dynamically update without page reloads.
- **Responsive Layout**: Clean and user-friendly interface with sections for weather and news.
